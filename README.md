Laravel uses the utf8mb4 character set by default, which includes support for storing "emojis" in the database. If you are running a version of MySQL older than the 5.7.7 release or MariaDB older than the 10.2.2 release, you may need to manually configure the default string length generated by migrations in order for MySQL to create indexes for them. You may configure this by calling the Schema::defaultStringLength method within your AppServiceProvider:

`Update your /app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php to contain:`
```php
        use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

        /**
         * Bootstrap any application services.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function boot()
        {
            Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
        }
```

- Typically, you may use a web server such as Apache or Nginx to serve your Laravel applications. If you are on PHP 5.4+ and would like to use PHP's built-in development server, you may use the serve Artisan command

        php artisan serve


`Note`

- You have to add <u><b>Accept</b></u> `application/json` in header request
